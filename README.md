## Description

This hectic versus game is a battle for space. Fuel up the thrusters in the center wall and push it into your opponents base to win!
Lob countermeasures to your enemies side to make their life hard!

### Items:
 * Fuel Tank - Place one in all 3 Thrusters to activate the fire button and power the wall!
 * C4 - Throw it at your opponent to disable them for a few seconds, but careful, if they react fast enough it might come flying right back at you!
